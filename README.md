-All of the experiments are carried out and descreibed in the main.ipynb notebook
- in each cell several configurations are tried, the average mean error yielded by them is displayed as output of the cell. The scores for all tested combinations are named and sorted from the best to the worts with regards to avergae error. 

-The source code for the algorithms is contained in the reccomenders.py file, with description of given algorithms
